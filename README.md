# FlatUI Theme

Flat UI theme for Sublime Text 2 and Sublime Text 3.

Project site: Coming soon.

## Installation

The FlatUI is designed to work with the latest development builds of Sublime Text, including [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/dev) and [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3dev).

### Using Git

If you are a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text application settings area.

You can locate your Sublime Text `Packages` directory by using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`.

While inside the `Packages` directory, clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/acondiff/flatui-theme/ "Theme - FlatUI"

### Download Manually

* Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
* Unzip the files and rename the folder to `Theme - FlatUI`
* Find your `Packages` directory using the menu item  `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`
* Copy the folder into your Sublime Text `Packages` directory

## Activating the theme

To configure Sublime Text to use the theme, follow the instructions below for your specific version.

### Sublime Text 2

* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "FlatUI.sublime-theme"`

**Example Sublime Text 2 User Settings**

    {
        "theme": "FlatUI.sublime-theme"
    }

### Sublime Text 3

* Open your User Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User`
* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `"theme": "FlatUI 3.sublime-theme"`

**Example Sublime Text 3 User Settings**

    {
        "theme": "FlatUI 3.sublime-theme"
    }

## Additional Features

### Sidebar Folder Icons

FlatUI Theme has the ability to use folder icons in the sidebar.

If you'd like to use folder icons in the sidebar instead of the regular arrows, add the following custom setting to your `Settings - User` file:

    "flatui_folder_icons": true

### Retina Resolution UI

FlatUI Theme has been designed to take advantage of retina resolution (high-dpi) displays.


### Theme Customisation

Sublime Text provides an elegant way to tweak existing themes without having to duplicate or maintain a separate copy of the original theme. If there are aspects of FlatUI Theme that you would like to adjust, take a look at the [theme customisation](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/wiki/Theme-customisation) wiki page.

## Bonus Options

### Syntax Highlighting Colour Schemes

The Soda Light screenshot uses a modified version of Espresso Tutti Colori and the Soda Dark screenshot uses a modified version of Monokai.

If you'd like to use the syntax highlighting schemes shown in the screenshots: 

* Locate the `tmtheme` file in `Packages/Theme - FlatUI/Color Schemes/`
* Copy and paste the `tmtheme` file in the Sublime Text `Packages/User` folder
* Enable the colour scheme via `Preferences -> Color Scheme -> User`

## Development

Please note, Sublime Text dev builds move quickly and changes can occur with the theme API between releases, so there may be occasions where the theme doesn't quite work with a brand new dev release.
